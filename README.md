# slingo
Reading from LTR &amp; RTL for faster reading speeds

The script allows for uploading text then takes the text of every other line and 
flips the order of the words as well as the characters in each of those words.
A kind of slinking text is created as a result allowing for reading in both directions
and reducing the time spent returning to the initial side of the page.

This script was written with help from Bard.
